My vim config

Meant for writing plain text with timestamps and annotations.

I don't really do vim, mostly use it as a visual ed.

Similarly, the use of the HJKL keys for moving the cursor in the vi editor and
its descendants also stems from the ADM-3A; it had the cursor-movement arrows
printed on those four keys.

NB: `indent/python.vim` is maintained using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code),
as the upstream python indentation plugin annoys me.


Emacs' point model (never on a character) and [lossless file editing](https://kyo.iroiro.party/en/posts/why-rewriting-emacs-is-hard/#lossless-file-editing)
are awesome.
