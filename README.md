I try to customize as little as possible.

Similarly, the use of the HJKL keys for moving the cursor in the vi editor and
its descendants also stems from the ADM-3A; it had the cursor-movement arrows
printed on those four keys.

APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection.  It is the language of the
future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation
of coding bums.
