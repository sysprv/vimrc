My vimrc.

I try to customize as little as possible.




Bill Joy's Aug-1984 interview for Unix Review: http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~kirkenda/joy84.html

	REVIEW: What would you do differently?

	JOY: I wish we hadn't used all the keys on the keyboard. I think one of the
	interesting things is that vi is really a mode-based editor. I think as
	mode-based editors go, it pretty good. One of the good things about EMACS,
	though, is its programmability and the modelessness. Those are two ideas which never
	occurred to me. I also wasn't very good at optimizing code when I wrote vi.
	I think the redisplay module of the editor is almost intractable. It does a
	really good job for what it does, but when you're writing programs as you're
	learning... That's why I stopped working on it.
